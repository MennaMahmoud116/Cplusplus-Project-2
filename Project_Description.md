Mimicking AUC's Banner Self Service

Menna T-allah Mahmoud Abdallahi

This project aims to mimic the banner self-service of the American University in Cairo. Briefly, the AUC's banner normally is the platform where students track their registered courses and enroll in new courses. This project mimics the process of the registration of the courses using C++ programming language, by setting the time slots for each course and identifying its credit hours, its CRN code, and its prerequisites, and in which semester will it be offered, i.e. Fall, Spring...etc. And finally, display each student's registered courses, total credit hours accomplished, the number of courses enrolled in, cumulative GPA, and currently running courses.
